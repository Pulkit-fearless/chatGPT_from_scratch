1. We started with writing a sample input/output response from claude api.   
2. While writing the above api we had to chose a model. 
3. While chosing a model has three dimensions to cosider - speed, capability and cost.. we also need to create benchmark tests..these tests should serve as a guiding light as to which model we should use among a set of possible models.
