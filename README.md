## Given a model API what does it take to develop a user application around it.

We will need a dummy use case for which we are starting with an ai-tutor. I feel that the techniques we would be using and learning are generalised and whatever use case we have should not change that much. 


We will be starting with implementing context engineering techniques like:  
1.) compaction  
2.) note-taking  
3.) multi-agent architecture  
4.) prompt caching
